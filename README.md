# fruitclassification
This project utilizes Neural Network to predict fruit name based on images uploaded
The dataset used is taken from : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshsaxenadn/fruits-classification 
which consists of 10k images of various size, shape, colours and distributed under 5 categories.

In this case, we'll also try to use pretrained model to see the capability of pretrained model in recognizing
fruits based on its images
